ID year Detection for Engineering Students using Python.

As artificial intelligence and data science student, I am immersed in a dynamic landscape of challenges and opportunities within the realm of technology. In line with my academic pursuits, I am excited to present my project: "ID Year Detection for Engineering Students."

This Python-based project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and classify the academic years of engineering students using real-time video input from a webcam. Through the integration of libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and pyttsx3, this system identifies specific color ranges associated with different academic years' identity cards.

Upon capturing a frame from the webcam, the system converts it to the HSV color space for more effective color segmentation. It then iterates through predefined color ranges corresponding to different academic years, identifying contours within the specified color thresholds. Once a contour of sufficient size is detected, the system determines the corresponding academic year based on predefined criteria.
